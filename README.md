# Manufacturing-Analysis
## Project Objective
This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing operations data to monitor production performance and identify inefficiencies. The analysis helps stakeholders understand operational bottlenecks, quality issues, and productivity trends through interactive dashboards and KPI tracking.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing data to evaluate operational performance across different plants, products, and time periods. By leveraging data analytics techniques and interactive dashboards, the project helps stakeholders monitor KPIs such as production volume, defect rates, downtime, and efficiency, enabling data‑driven decision‑making.

## Problem Statement
Manufacturing organizations often struggle to track production efficiency and identify bottlenecks due to fragmented data and lack of actionable insights. The goal of this project is to transform raw manufacturing data into meaningful insights that highlight inefficiencies, improve productivity, and support operational optimization.
