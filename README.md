# Manufacturing-Analysis
## Project Objective
To analyze manufacturing production data and identify efficiency gaps, quality issues, and operational bottlenecks using KPI-driven dashboards.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing data to evaluate operational performance across different plants, products, and time periods. By leveraging data analytics techniques and interactive dashboards, the project helps stakeholders monitor KPIs such as production volume, defect rates, downtime, and efficiency, enabling data‑driven decision‑making.

## Problem Statement
Manufacturing organizations often struggle to track production efficiency and identify bottlenecks due to fragmented data and lack of actionable insights. The goal of this project is to transform raw manufacturing data into meaningful insights that highlight inefficiencies, improve productivity, and support operational optimization.

## Data Set Used
<a href = "https://github.com/chaitrabijjal/Manufacturing-Analysis/blob/97fa7ab33fadeb0627e6dc63a714b90c63c4a80f/Manufacturing%20Dataset.xlsx">Manufacturing Dataset (Excel File).</a>

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.

- KPI definition and calculation (Production Efficiency, Defect Rate, Downtime %).

- Time‑series and trend analysis.

- Comparative analysis across plants, products, and shifts.

- Interactive dashboard design for performance monitoring.

## Key Insights
- Identified high‑performing and underperforming production lines

- Analyzed defect trends to highlight quality issues

- Discovered peak and low production periods using time‑based analysis

- Highlighted downtime patterns impacting overall efficiency

- Enabled quick comparison of plant‑level performance
